## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### What I learned

In my recent project, I learned how to use the `fetch` API in JavaScript for making network requests. I also gained a solid understanding of handling promises in JavaScript, including how they operate in their three states: pending, resolved, and rejected. Additionally, I explored new features in JavaScript such as DOM manipulation, and enhanced my skills in filtering data based on input values

- Mastered the use of the `fetch` API in JavaScript for making HTTP requests.
- Deepened my understanding of promise handling in JavaScript.
  - Explored how promises transition between their three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
- Delved into advanced JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation.
- Improved techniques for filtering data based on user input.
- Enhanced my ability to manage asynchronous operations efficiently.
- Developed robust debugging and error-handling skills in JavaScript.
- Sharpened problem-solving skills through practical data manipulation tasks.

### Useful resources

- [REST Countries Website](https://restcountries.com) - This website was instrumental in providing all the API's needed to fetch and display country data. I thoroughly enjoyed working with these API's.
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) - This API offers comprehensive country data as a JSON object, which can be easily managed using JavaScript. The object includes various fields such as name, population, region, capital and more providing detailed information about each country. I highly recommend exploring this API to learn how to effectively handle such data in JavaScript.
